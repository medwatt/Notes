# Regular Expressions

## PERL Syntax

### Character Classes

#### Common Character Classes

Consider the string `AAA 123 BBB`.

| Class | Description                                        | Example                       |
| ---   | ---                                                | --                            |
| `\d`  | One digit from 0 to 9                              | `\d+` matches `123`           |
| `\w`  | Word character: ASCII letter, digit, or underscore | `\w+` matches `AAA` and `BBB` |
| `\s`  | Whitespace character: space, tab, (and others)     | `\s` matches the two spaces   |

An uppercase version of any of the above classes represents the complement of the
class. For instance, `\D` represents anything that is not a digit.

#### White-Space Classes

| Class  | Description               |
| ---    | ---                       |
| `\t`   | Tab character             |
| `\r`   | Carriage return character |
| `\n`   | Line feed character       |
| `\r\n` | Line separator on Windows |

#### Custom Character Classses

| Class     | Description                                                                 | Example                                                |
| ---       | ---                                                                         | --                                                     |
| `[…]`     | Starts a character class.                                                   | `[m-q]` matches any lowercase letter fro m to q        |
| `[^…]`    | Negates a character class.                                                  | `[^\d\s]` matches anything that is not in `\d` or `\s` |
| `[…-[…]]` | One character that is in those on the left, but not in the subtracted class | `[a-z-[aeiou]]` matches any lowercase consonant        |

#### Special Characters

- The character `.` matches any character except a line break.

- The characters `. + * ? ^ $ ( ) [ ] { } \ |` have special meanings when used
  in a pattern.  `\` works as an escape character and when followed by any of
  `. + * ? ^ $ ( ) [ ] { } \ |` suppresses their special meaning. That is, to
  match `+`, we use `\+` in the pattern string.

- `\Q…\E` matches the characters between `\Q` and `\E` literally, suppressing the meaning of special characters.


#### Anchors

Consider the multiline string below:

```
this is the first line and this is where it ends
this is the second line
this is the the third line
```

| Anchor | Description                                                   | Example                                                      |
| ---    | ---                                                           | --                                                           |
| `^`    | Start of string or start of line depending on multiline mode. | `^this` matches `this` at the beginning of lines 1, 2, and 3 |
| `\A`   | Beginning of string. Never matches after line breaks.         | `\Athis` matches `this` at the beginning of line 1           |
| `$`    | End of string or end of line depending on multiline mode.     | `line$` matches `line` at the end of lines 2 and 3           |
| `\z`   | Very end of the string. Never matches before line breaks.     | `line\z` matches `line` at the end of line 3                 |
| `\b`   | Word boundary                                                 | `\bis\b` matches all `is` that are flanked by spaces         |

### Quantifiers

Consider `s1 = aaabbb`, `s2 = aaaa1bbbb`,  and `s3 = aaaaa123bbbbb`.

| Quantifier | Description                                                                 | Example                                   |
| ---        | ---                                                                         | --                                        |
| `+`        | One or more. The `+` is "greedy" (matches the longest possible).            | `a+\d+b+` matches `s2` and `s3`           |
| `*`        | Zero or more times. The `*` is "greedy".                                    | `a+\d*b+` matches all three strings       |
| `?`        | Once or none. `?` makes a quantifier "lazy".                                | `a+\d?b+` matches `s1` and `s2`           |
| `{3}`      | Exactly three times                                                         | `^a{3}\d*b{3}$` matches only `s1`         |
| `{2,4}`    | Two to four times. It is "greedy" by default. Append `?` to make it lazy.   | `^a{3,4}\d*b{3,4}$` matches `s1` and `s2` |
| `{3,}`     | Three or more times. It is "greedy" by default. Append `?` to make it lazy. | `^a{4,}\d*b{4,}$` matches `s2` and `s3`   |

### Logic

| Character | Description              |
| ---       | ---                      |
| `\|`      | Alternation / OR operand |
| `(…)`     | Capturing group          |
| `(?:… )`  | Non-capturing group      |
| `\1`      | Contents of Group 1      |
| `\2`      | Contents of Group 2      |

Consider the string `the ant is in the apple`. The pattern `a(nt|pple)` will
match both `ant` and `apple`. Surrounding a pattern with round brackets tells
the regex engine to capture (save) the matched string. The content of the
captured string can be used in matching or replacement by using the
back-reference operator `\num`, where `num` is the index of the captured group.
The default behaviour of round brackets is to capture the matched string. We
can tell the regex engine not to save the matched string by using `(?:…)`.

### Inline modifiers

| Character | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---       | ---                                                                                                           |
| `(?i)`    | Turn on case insensitivity for the remainder of the regular expression. `(?-i)` turns off case insensitivity. |
| `(?s)`    | Turn on "dot matches newline" for the remainder of the regular expression.                                    |

### Lookarounds

| Character | Description                    | Example                                        |
| ---       | ---                            | ---                                            |
| `(?=…)`   | Zero-width positive lookahead  | `t(?=s)`  matches the second `t` in `streets`  |
| `(?<=…)`  | Zero-width positive lookbehind | `(?<=s)t` matches the first `t` in `streets`.  |
| `(?!…)`   | Zero-width negative lookahead  | `t(?!s)`  matches the first `t` in `streets`.  |
| `(?<!…)`  | Zero-width negative lookbehind | `(?<!s)t` matches the second `t` in `streets`. |
