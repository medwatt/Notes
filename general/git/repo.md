You: 

There's a github repo. I want to modify a line of code, but retain the ability to continue to get updates from the main repo. In other words, give me the steps to maintain a fork the proper way.

ChatGPT: 

To maintain a fork of a GitHub repository and make modifications while still being able to receive updates from the original repository, follow these steps:

 
2. **Fork the Repository** : On GitHub, go to the original repository and click the "Fork" button at the top right. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
 
4. **Clone Your Fork** : Clone the forked repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```
 
6. **Add the Original Repository as a Remote**  (often called `upstream`):


```csharp
git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalowner/repository-name.git
```
 
8. **Create a New Branch** : This branch is where you will make your modifications. It's good practice to keep your changes separate from the main branch.


```css
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
 
10. **Make Your Changes** : Modify the code as needed in your new branch.
 
12. **Commit and Push Your Changes** : Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them and push the branch to your GitHub fork:


```pgsql
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
 
14. **Keep Your Fork Updated** : Periodically, you should sync your fork with the original repository to get the latest updates:
 
  - Fetch the latest changes from the original repo:


```sql
git fetch upstream
```
 
  - Check out your main branch (or master/main, depending on the naming convention):


```css
git checkout main
```
 
  - Merge the changes from the original repo into your local main branch:


```bash
git merge upstream/main
```
 
  - Push the updates to your GitHub fork:


```css
git push origin main
```
 
16. **Merge Your Changes** : When you need to incorporate your modifications with updates from the original repository, you might need to merge or rebase your branch:
 
  - Check out your branch:


```nginx
git checkout your-branch-name
```
 
  - Rebase onto the updated main branch (or merge, if you prefer):


```css
git rebase main
```
 
  - Resolve any conflicts, if they arise, then continue the rebase:


```kotlin
git rebase --continue
```
 
  - Push your rebased branch to your fork (use force-push if necessary):


```pgsql
git push origin your-branch-name --force
```


By following these steps, you can maintain a fork of a repository, make your own changes, and still keep up with updates from the original repository.

You: 

how to check all upstreams associated with the repo ?

ChatGPT: 

To check all remote repositories associated with your local Git repository, including the `upstream`, use the following command:


```bash
git remote -v
```

This command lists all remotes along with the URLs for fetching and pushing. Look for the `upstream` in the output to see the details. If `upstream` is set up, it will be listed there.

You: 

If I want to build the file and prevent the results from making changes to the git repo, how to do it?

ChatGPT: 

To build files and ensure that the results do not affect your Git repository, you can follow these steps:

 
2. **
Use `.gitignore`** :
Add file names or patterns of the files you want to exclude from Git tracking to a `.gitignore` file in your repository. This prevents untracked files from being added to the repository accidentally.
For example, if your build process generates files in a `build/` directory, add the following line to your `.gitignore`:


```
build/
```
 
4. **Build in a Separate Directory** :
Configure your build process to output results to a directory that is listed in your `.gitignore` file. This ensures that all build artifacts are kept out of your Git tracking.
 
6. **Check the Current Status** :
Before committing your changes, use the `git status` command to ensure that no unwanted files are staged for commit:


```lua
git status
```
 
8. **Clean the Repository** :
If you accidentally build without using `.gitignore` and need to clean up the repository, you can use `git clean`. This command removes untracked files from your working directory. Be careful, as this cannot be undone.

To see what would be removed, you can do a dry run first:



```nginx
git clean -n
```


To remove untracked directories and files:



```nginx
git clean -fd
```


By following these steps, you can safely build your files without affecting the Git repository's status.

You: 

i don't want to use a git ignore. I want to clean things afterwards, but this git clean is not working.

~/git/alttab desktop_option_3_fix !12 ❯ git status   
On branch desktop_option_3_fix
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   Makefile.in
	modified:   aclocal.m4
	modified:   compile
	modified:   config.h.in
	modified:   configure
	modified:   depcomp
	modified:   doc/Makefile.in
	modified:   install-sh
	modified:   missing
	modified:   src/Makefile.in
	modified:   tap-driver.sh
	modified:   test/Makefile.in

ChatGPT: 

If you have changes that are not staged for commit and you want to clean them up without using `.gitignore`, you can use the `git restore` command to discard changes in your working directory. This command will revert modified files back to their last committed state.

Here's how to discard changes to all modified files:



```bash
git restore .
```


Or if you want to discard changes to specific files, you can specify them individually:



```bash
git restore Makefile.in aclocal.m4 compile config.h.in configure depcomp doc/Makefile.in install-sh missing src/Makefile.in tap-driver.sh test/Makefile.in
```


This command will undo all modifications and revert the files to their last committed state, effectively cleaning your working directory of any changes. Be sure to use this carefully, as it will discard all your local changes.

You: 

Suppose I want to make push my changes to the original repo. Give me the steps to do it.

ChatGPT: 

To push your changes to the original repository from your fork, you typically need to submit a pull request. Here are the steps:

 
2. **Commit Your Changes** :
Ensure all your changes are committed locally in your branch.


```sql
git add .
git commit -m "Detailed description of your changes"
```
 
4. **Push Your Branch to Your Fork** :
Make sure your branch is up-to-date with the original repository’s main branch (assuming `main` is the default branch).


```css
git pull upstream main
git push origin your-branch-name
```
 
6. **Create a Pull Request** :

  - Go to your repository on GitHub.

  - You'll often see a "Compare & pull request" button for your recently pushed branches. Click it.

  - Review the changes between your branch and the original repository's main branch.

  - Select the original repository and the main branch as the base, and your fork and your branch as the compare.
 
  - Fill out the form to create a pull request:
 
    - **Title** : Give your pull request a descriptive title.
 
    - **Description** : Provide a detailed description of the changes and why you made them.

  - Submit the pull request by clicking on "Create pull request".
 
8. **Wait for Feedback** :

  - The maintainers of the original repository will review your pull request. They might request changes or discuss potential modifications.
 
  - If changes are requested, make them on your local machine in the same branch, then commit and push those changes to your branch:


```pgsql
git add .
git commit -m "Made requested changes"
git push origin your-branch-name
```
 
10. **Merge the Pull Request** :

  - Once the pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch of the original repository.

  - You’ll receive a notification once the pull request is merged.


These steps allow you to contribute your changes to the original project while keeping a clear history of your contributions.
