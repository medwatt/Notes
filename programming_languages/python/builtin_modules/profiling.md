# Profiling

Profiling is the process of analyzing the performance of a program in order to
identify bottlenecks that can be optimized.

Here are some common options for profiling Python code:

1. `cProfile`: This is a built-in Python module for profiling code. It provides
   a simple way to profile code and measure the performance of your code.

2. `line_profiler`: This is a Python package that provides line-by-line
   profiling for Python code. It works by decorating the functions that you
   want to profile with the `@profile` decorator, and then running the profiler
   using the `LineProfiler` class.

3. `py-spy`: This is a high-performance profiler for Python that allows you to
   profile your code in real-time. It provides detailed profiles of your code,
   including information on function calls, memory usage, and more.

4. `memory_profiler`: This is a Python package for profiling the memory usage
   of Python code. It allows you to measure the memory usage of your code and
   identify areas where your code may be using more memory than necessary.

5. `pyflame`: This is a tool for generating flame graphs of Python code, which
   can be useful for visualizing the performance of your code and identifying
   performance bottlenecks.


Here are some of the main methods provided by `cProfile`:

- `run(command, filename=None)`: This function runs the code in `command` and
  profiles it. The optional `filename` parameter specifies the name of a file
  to which the profile data should be written. If `filename` is not specified,
  the profile data is written to stdout.

- `enable()`: This function enables profiling.

- `disable()`: This function disables profiling.

- `print_stats([sort])`: This function prints a summary of the profile data to
  stdout. The optional `sort` parameter specifies the criteria used to sort the
  profile data.
